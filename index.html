        <h1>Food Timeline</h1>
        <p>Ever wonder how the ancient Romans fed their armies? What the pioneers cooked along the Oregon Trail? Who invented the potato chip...and why? So do we!!! Food history presents a fascinating buffet of popular lore and contradictory facts. Some experts say it's impossible to express this topic in exact timeline format. They are correct. Most foods are not invented; they evolve. We make food history fun.</p>

        <h2>New Updates: August 2024</h2>
        <p>As of earlier this year, ALL of the books from Lynne Olver's collection have now been cataloged! You can view the list of materials, including donated books and periodicals, as well as the processed collection of her research files, in this list. We are so grateful for the work of our colleagues in Metadata Services, who have been instrumental in making this happen!</p>
        <p>You can also view a longer list of donated materials plus scholarship by Olver. In other words, this is all the Lynne Olver related resources accessible through Virginia Tech University Libraries.</p>
        <p>The manuscript materials and research files from Lynne Olver are processed and the finding aid is online.</p>
        <p>This summer, we've been working on some major broken link repair on the site! We're grateful for people who have reported issues. The main index page should be in full working order and we're going to start working through subpages next.</p>
        <p>However, due to significant amounts of spam, we are turning off the reporting form while we have a chance to sort through everything that has been submitted and while we find a better alternative for reporting issues.</p>
        <p>Want to know more about the site's creation and history? See the "About this site" section at the bottom of this page. Want to submit a broken link, offer a link suggestion, and/or offer a topic suggestion? See the bottom of the Food Timeline homepage.</p>
